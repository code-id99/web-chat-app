Web Chat Application
This web-based chat applicationis i built using PHP, AJAX, JavaScript, JSON, HTML, and CSS. The app allows real-time communication 
between users with a simple and interactive chat interface.

PHP 
- I used php mostly oon the server side for:
  >> Handling logic such as processing data, managing databases and more.
  >> Managing server-side interactions, such as sending emails, messages, user     
    authentification also managing sessions.

AJAX
- i choose to use AJAX for making requests to the server without the entire page.
- Also allows to load sending data in the background such as notifications and loading new posts.
JavaScript 
- Then i used javasacript to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to page, form validation, animations and pop-up windows.

JSON 
- I choose to use JSON since it is commonly used on lightweight data-intercharge format.
- i used it for exchange data between the client and the server following AJAX syntax.
  
HTML 
- // ----//

CSS
- //----//

Features:

>> Real-time messaging: Messages are instantly sent and received without refreshing the page, thanks to AJAX.
>> User-friendly interface: Built with a clean and responsive design using HTML and CSS.
>> Lightweight: The app is optimized for fast performance with minimal resources.
>> Uses JSON for efficient data exchange between the client and server.

Requirements:

>> PHP 7.x or higher
>> A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to run the PHP application, in this case i am using Apache.
>> Basic knowledge of front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
